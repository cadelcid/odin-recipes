        It should be noted that while I am Latino, I am not much of a cook or 
        expert of Mexican cuisine. I have limited experience making Mexican food. 
        I am writing a recipe that I have used myself and is credited to the 
        Youtube channel 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0tVWRw4aNoVqXaobA8E_Ig" >
        "Cooking Con Claudia"</a>. It turned out incredibly delicious and is perfect 
        for those cold winter days.
        Her video recipe for Pozole Verde with pork is found
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S_1Tnaf66k">here</a>. I am giving credit 
        where credit is due, and am simply writing out her instructions as text.

    <ol><h2>Steps</h2>
        <li>Fill a pot with 16 cups of water and set to medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tbsp of salt, 1/2 onion, 1 garlic head,
            about 2 sprigs of fresh thyme, 3 bay leaves, 
            and oregano to your liking.</li>
        <li>While waiting for water to come to a boil, cut meat into
            bite-sized pieces. Once water is boiling, add in the meat.</li>
        <li>After boiling for 15 minutes, lower heat to medium-low heat.
            Remove scum if desired.</li>
        <li>Cover pot with a lid and cook anywhere from 1 hour to 1 hour
            and 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While we wait for our meat to boil, we are going to make our sauce.</li>
        <li>Begin by roasting the peppers. You can either roast by stovetop or oven.
            Roast on all sides until it is charred. Start with roasting the 4 anaheim
            and 2 poblano peppers.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a large bowl and cover with aluminum foil. We want
            them to sweat.</li>
        <li>Next, we will roast the 5 serrano peppers, 14 tomatillos, and the leftover
            half of onion omitted from the boiling meat. Char them all.</li>
        <li>Transfer the serrrano peppers to the same bowl as the other peppers to also 
            sweat for about 10 minutes. Transfer the roasted onion and tomatillos to 
            a blender cup.</li>
        <li>After letting the peppers sweat, we are going to deseed them and remove the
            stems.Then throw the peppers in the blender cup.</li>
        <li>While waiting for the broth to finish, open your can of white hominy and
            give it a good rinse. Feel free to prepare your garnishments as well 
            (if any).</li>
        <li>When the broth is done cooking, take two cups of the broth, the 1/2 onion, 
            and the garlic head to blender cup.</li>
        <li>Also add to the blender cup: the remaining 1/2 an onion, 4 garlic cloves,
            1 bunch cilantro, spinach, 2 bay leaves, 2 tbsp chicken bouillon,
            1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp cumin.</li>
        <li>Blend it all together until you have a smooth sauce.Then add more spinach
            if desired and blend again.</li>
        <li>Fry your sauce with vegetable oil. Fry all of it on medium high heat and
            bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Carefully pour your sauce in the pot with the broth.</li>
        <Li>Take your can of white hominy and give it a good rinse, then add
            to the pot. Cook for 30 minutes.</Li>
        <li>Your pozole verde will be ready when your meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
