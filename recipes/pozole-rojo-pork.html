<h2>Description</h2>
"Pozole Rojo is a traditional recipe made with tender pork and hominy and simmered
in the most delicious chile broth, then piled with your favorite garnishments."

<p>
    It should be noted that while I am Latino, I am not much of a cook or 
    expert of Mexican cuisine. I have limited experience making Mexican food. 
    I am writing a recipe that I have used myself and is credited to the 
    Youtube channel 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0tVWRw4aNoVqXaobA8E_Ig" >
    "Cooking Con Claudia"</a>. It turned out incredibly delicious and is perfect 
    for those cold winter days.
    Her video recipe for Pozole Rojo with pork is found
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKx5NXQijtU">here</a>. I am giving credit 
    where credit is due, and am simply writing out her instructions as text.
